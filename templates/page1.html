    <h1>About the data:
        This data takes 1312 arabica and 28 robusta (two types of coffee beans) coffee beans from different producers and rates them on a standardized scale. All of the reviewers in the project were trained by the coffee institute. The data includes metrics such as body, balance, and sweetness and creates a rating out of 100 for each coffee. The data also includes information about the coffeeâ€™s origin such as the owner of the farm, or the elevation it was farmed at. This website seeks to show to users the different trends in the data, and allows them to search through the data and create easy to understand graphs and metrics.
